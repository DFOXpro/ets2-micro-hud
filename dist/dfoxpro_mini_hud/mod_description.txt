Nano HUD for ETS2

[blue] This mod was built and tested on the standard game version 1.30.X

This mod is a fork of ptr1ck's http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=718966063

Changes from original:
- It uses half of space
- It don't show:
	- Truck Damage: Because it's in an information panel
	- Current speed: Because it's in the dashboard
	- Current gear: Because it's in the dashboard
	- Fuel level: Because it's in the dashboard
	- Game time: Because it's in the dashboard
	- ETA: @TODO

[green] Text from original author:

This is a minimalist user interface that changes the Adviser panels in the game by adding a bottom info bar and replacing the Navigator screen.
All backgrounds are vector based to give a smooth uniform look.
The interface was created so that you can maintain information on the screen in the smallest format possible without the Navigator screen showing.

The Navigator screen (GPS) has been changed so that it toggles either on or off with F3.
Hit F3 once to show the bottom bar and GPS, hit it again to hide the GPS so that you can use in-dash GPS unobstructed with the bottom bar.

The new bottom bar has information shown for (from left to right):
-Running line information
-Mail
-Money
-Truck damage
-Current speed with speeding indicator highlight
-Current gear
-Fuel level
-Fatigue
-Game time
-ETA (now always shown with bar)

Navigation screen:
-Can be hidden independently from the bottom bar (F3)
-Smooth, solid background.

Information panels:
-Relocated to be at steering wheel
-Independent of the Navigation screen
--Unfixable Minor Issue: Navigation screen will not update animation when an information panel is active.
---In-dash GPS is not affected by this issue and will keep animating.

This mod was developed with a single monitor. It may not display correctly if you span multiple screens with the game.
Hemil's mod was used as a partial basis for this mod along with a lot of customization on my end.
